# Heat Transfer FEA
![Image1](/Heat-Transfer-FEA/Images/Image1.png)
A basic finite element analysis for transient heat transfer (with heat generation) within python.

WIP:
  - Heat generation feature has not been tested.
  - Heat conduction seems to occur with left-ward bias (region to the left is hotter than it should be).
  - External node T_{i + 1} equation generation appears to be incorrect.
  - Heat transfer to 'environment' nodes does not seem to be working.

A lot more math is required to complete this project, once midterms are over I will try to update it. 
Thanks for reading me!
